     "description": "In this project, a Logistic Regression classification model is run on the Wine dataset from UCI repository, with the 'Class' variable as the target. This variable stores the type of wine and there are 3 classes of wines in this dataset. Initially a preliminary exploratory data analysis is run on the dataset. The performance of the model is judged using Accuracy Score (94.4%) and F1-Score (0.945).",
